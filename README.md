# Data Science Portfolio
 DS projects in Python, RStudio and Tableau platforms, there are three different folders setup to review the knowledge I have gained over the past couple of years. This is to demostrate knowledge in different platforms using techiques you must use really depends on the kind of business problem that you want to address. Different data science techniques could result in different outcomes and so offer different insights for the business. Each code file with display data science models used:
1.	Business understanding: the domain knowledge that will be described in the next section.
2.	Data understanding: descriptive statistics and the assessment of data quality.
3.	Data preparation: data cleaning, constructing new variables, and merging data sets.
4.	Modelling: A model is a description of the assumed structure of the sample of data observations. Modelling includes the selection of techniques (machine learning has many algorithms that construct models) and running them.
5.	Evaluation: the evaluation of how well the chosen model meets business objectives.
6.	Deployment: deploying the model so that users can use it with future data as well as
