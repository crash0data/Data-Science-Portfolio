# DS Visualization  
This folder will display how I was able to connect to different sources using Blogs, Infographics, Python, R, Tableau Desktop; by build, aesthetic, and share provide approaches used in storytelling. Each day I look to evolve my graphic design work after taking this a data visualization course. While we are communicating through data with storytelling, the audience level must be established first before creating the visualization piece.
